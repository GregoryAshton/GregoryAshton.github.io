I am a research fellow working with Prof. Greg Ashton on hierarchical profile domain timing of radio pulsars. My background is in using pulsars as tools to study interstellar medium. I graduated from a Masters at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram (IISER TVM). I then went on to pursue my PhD at the University of Galway working with Prof. Aaron Golden and Prof. Evan Keane. My PhD thesis title is "Examining ecliptic pulsars using the LOFAR telescope" focussing on studying solar wind and interstellar medium using pulsar timing methods of ecliptic pulsars. In addition to this, I am a member of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) aiming to discover nano-hertz Gravitational waves. I was instrumental in leading observations on several LOFAR stations to contribute to the IPTA efforts.</p>
<p>Aside from academics, I am passionate about promoting astronomy among young people. I have taken part in outreach activities, including representing radio astronomy at a Trinity College Dublin Space Society event held at the Irish LOFAR Observatory. I have also contributed to initiatives aimed at raising scientific awareness among underprivileged children in India. Outside of work, I enjoy travelling, playing badminton, and watching cricket.</p>

I am an Research Fellow working with Greg Ashton on timing variations of radio pulsars, with a particular interest on the glitch phenomena observed in the PSR B1828-11 radio pulsar. My background is in Particle Physics, having obtained a Masters degree in 2019 and a PhD degree in 2023 at Royal Holloway, University of London. My Masters project, Calibration of a High-Pressure Time Projection Chamber, involved working on the hardware and calibration systems of a High-Pressure Time Projection Chamber, to be used in Neutrino Physics Research. I was directly involved in the calibration and construction of this detector. My PhD project, Detector Development for Particle Physics and Applications to Environmental Monitoring, involved the development of a novel device, called PlomBOX, employing a CMOS sensor and lead-sensing bacteria to assay lead in drinking water, up to the World Health Organisation’s upper limit of 10 ppb. I was involved in the development of the data acquisition and slow control tools and developed the analysis interface used by the PlomBOX.</p>
<p>Outside research, I am passionate about making physics available to people from working class backgrounds and as such I help lead a Working Class in Physics Forum at Royal Holloway.
I am an avid gamer, love to read and enjoy nature walks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start date: 2023</li>
<li>Thesis title: TBC</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a PhD student in astrophysics, working with Greg Ashton and Nicolo Colombo on using machine learning for gravitational wave analysis. I am currently working on applying conformal prediction to determine uncertainties. When making use of machine learning, for example applied to gravitational wave parameter estimation, quantifying the uncertainty of how accurate the estimate is is essential. Conformal prediction provides a method to determine this uncertainty for any point prediction algorithm. </p>
<p>My background is in theoretical physics and astrophysics, with a Masters degree from the University of Glasgow. In my masters project, working with John Veitch, I applied machine learning in the form of normalising flows to model and hence remove glitches from gravitational wave data, with the aim to improve the Bayesian inference based parameter estimation in the presence of glitches. </p>
<p>Besides research, I enjoy volunteering with projects promoting science and engaging young people in STEM, and have been involved in various projects with the Swedish Federation of Young Scientists, such as organising Rays Research Academy for Young Scientists. In my free time I also enjoy a variety of outdoor activities as well as good literature.</p>

<li>Thesis title: TBC</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently a PhD student at Royal Holloway, working with Xavier Rojas and
Greg Ashton who is my second supervisor. My work is focused on an idea to
further the Weber bar resonance bar concept using Low-Temperature superdluid
optomechanics. I completed my MSci at Royal Holloway, my dissertation was
on modelling many body quantum systems; this also included a research review on
quantum computers and associated algorithms.</p>
<p>My previous projects include</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a computer model, to simulate many-body quantum systems and explore the Fermi-Dirac Distribution with Grégoire Ithier.</li>
<li>Designing and building a successful low-temperature experiment, currently used to introduce undergraduate to low temperature physics. This was under L. V. Levitin.</li>
<li>Designing and creating software in python to manage a vapor deposition nano-fabrication tool for Phil Meeson.</li>

<p>I am a PhD student in gravitational wave astronomy under the supervision of Dr. Greg Ashton. My research portfolio spans various facets of gravitational wave physics, where I actively contribute as a member of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). One significant aspect of my work involves gravitational wave data analysis, where I delve into the intricacies of parameter estimation. Thus far I have been looking into the problems arising from the approximations used in our analysis with the increasing amount of detected signals, and into the benefits introduced by using more detectors for the analysis and their dependence on the performance of the single detectors.</p>
<p>Following my MSc in Astrophysics in Potsdam, where I focused on Numerical Relativity simulations, I am still collaborating with Prof. Dr.  Tim Deatrich and Dr. Violetta Sagun, specifically exploring dark matter-admixed neutron stars and their detectability through our current and future ground-based detectors. I have completed my BSc in Physics at La Sapienza University in Rome, Italy, where my thesis on the constraints on the tidal deformability of neutron stars through gravitational waves was supervised by Prof. Dr. Francesco Pannarale.</p>
<p>Beyond the academic realm, I am passionately committed to fostering equal access to education globally. As a Cumberland Lodge Fellow in the 2023-2025 cohort, I actively participate in initiatives aimed at raising awareness of societal issues and trying to find solutions through dialogue. In this pursuit, in 2019 I founded a non-governmental organization dedicated to combating educational disparities, with a specific focus on enabling girls from underprivileged backgrounds to access secondary education. Additionally, I am a basketball player for the University team and my interests extend to the realms of African literature, history, and cooperative endeavors.</p>
