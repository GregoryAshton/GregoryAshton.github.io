In 2016, I completed my PhD Timing variations in neutron stars: models, inference and their implications for gravitational waves at the University of Southampton under the joint supervision of Prof. David Ian Jones and Dr. Reinhard Prix (Albert Einstein Institute, Hannover). I then worked as a Postdoc in Hannover with Reinhard and others in the Continuous Gravitational Wave group , before moving to Melbourne to work with Paul Lasky in Monash University (Melbourne Australia). In 2020, I moved back to the UK and am currently teaching foundation year maths at Royal Holloway. Contact: gregory.ashton@ligo.org My CV My list of publications Gallery News 12/Mar/2021 My students successfully nominated me for a You\u2019re Valued Award at Royal Holloway. I'm proud to add some of their comments here: \u201cGreg is an amazing teacher. His enthusiastic approach to teaching maths to us foundation year students has made us enthusiastic as well. he is very friendly and approachable and when we need help he very patiently helps explain everything to us. He is dedicated to make us understand all the concepts he teaches and help us learn to our best capacity.\u201d and \u201cGreg always focuses on our individual worries and makes sure we understand before moving on. He's very good at teaching and we're happy to have him as our maths professor :)\u201d. 08/Feb/2021 I presented Flickering of the Vela pulsar to the CAMK journal club. 28/Jan/2021 My PhD student Nikhil Sarin passed his pre-submission milestone. It has been a pleasure to watch Nik develop into a great researcher - his next employer will be lucky to have him. 27/Jan/2021 New paper on arXiv! Work led by David Keitel \"PyFstat: a Python package for continuous gravitational-wave data analysis\" which updates the latest on the PyFstat package for Continuous-Wave analyses. 14/Jan/2021 New paper! Work led by Eric Burns \"Identification of a Local Sample of Gamma-Ray Bursts Consistent with a Magnetar Giant Flare Origin\" hits the arXiv. 11/Jan/2021 Semester 2 gets underway at RHUL. I'm teaching FY1006 Mathematics II to 140 students in online mode for the foreseable future. 07/Jan/2021 I gave a talk titled \"The deepening mystery of the Vela radio-pulsar glitch\" at the Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University on our recent Vela paper. 04/Dec/2020 I gave an improptu talk to the University of Southampton's astrophysics group on our recent Vela paper. 16/Nov/2020 New paper \"Flickering of the Vela pulsar during its 2016 glitch\" on the arXiv. 10/Nov/2020 I was awarded the 2020 USERN Physical and Chemical Sciences prize . 04/Nov/2020 I gave a presentation to Royal Holloway's Physics group \"Turning Wiggles into Science\"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#dr-gregory-ashton","text":"","title":"Dr Gregory Ashton"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"I am a Adjunct Research Associate at Monash University and a Teaching Fellow at Royal Holloway (University of London), a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration .
