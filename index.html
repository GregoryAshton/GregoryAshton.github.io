This is a simple webpage for Gregory Ashton - a PhD student in Mathematics at
the University of Southampton. It is an attempt to collect some work that I find
interesting together, and as a place to leave myself reminders on how I did
certain things.


<div class="posts">
  <h2>Posts</h2>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span>:
          <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
