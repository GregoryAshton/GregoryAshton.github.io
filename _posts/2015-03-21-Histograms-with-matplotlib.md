In this post I want to cover some of the fundamentals when creating histograms
in `matplotlib`. There is already an easy to use `matplotlib` function `hist()`
which will do most of the standard visulisation needs, lets first review
this and then go on to some more complex tasks.

## The `plt.hist()` function

Here is a nice simple example of using `hist`:
[see here](http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/examples/pylab_examples/histogram_demo_extended.html).
