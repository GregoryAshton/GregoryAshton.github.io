# Pulications

* Ashton, G.; Jones, D. I.; Prix, R.: [The effect of timing noise on targeted 
  and narrow-band coherent searches for continuous gravitational waves
  ](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1410.8044A)

* Institute of Physics Gravitational Physics Group [2015 newsletter](

# Presentations

* Presentation at [Birmingham BritGrav
  2015](http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/britgrav15/) in which I presented work on
  [Applying Bayesian data analysis to learn about periodic variability in
  pulsars](BritGrav15.pdf).

* A [talk](Student_seminar02.pdf) on probability theory and Bayesian data
  analysis that I gave for the other PhD students st Southampton.

* Talk at [Cambridge BritGrav 2014](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/meetings/2014/britgrav.14) where
  I discussed the issue of detecting gravitational waves from neutron stars if 
  the waves are effected by timing noise. The slides can be found [here](BritGrav.pdf).
  I was awarded a runners up prize for best talk by the IoP.
