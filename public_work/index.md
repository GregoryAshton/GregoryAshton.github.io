# Presentations

* Talk at [Annual NewCompStar Conference in Istanbul
  (2016)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/472448/) discussing
  [Learning about neutron stars from pulsar precession observations](
https://indico.cern.ch/event/472448/contributions/1992071/attachments/1266420/1874875/GregAshtonIstanbul2016.pdf)
for which I was honoured to recieve the best student talk prize.

* Parallel session talk at [Annual NewCompStar Conference in Budapest
  (2015)](https://indico.kfki.hu/event/254/) discussing
  [Comparing different models of pulsar timing
  noise](https://indico.kfki.hu/event/254/session/6/contribution/126/material/slides/0.pdf)

* Presentation at [Birmingham BritGrav
  2015](http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/britgrav15/) in which I presented work on
  [Applying Bayesian data analysis to learn about periodic variability in
  pulsars](BritGrav15.pdf).

* A [talk](Student_seminar02.pdf) on probability theory and Bayesian data
  analysis that I gave for the other PhD students st Southampton.

* Talk at [Cambridge BritGrav 2014](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/meetings/2014/britgrav.14) where
  I discussed the issue of detecting gravitational waves from neutron stars if
  the waves are effected by timing noise. The slides can be found [here](BritGrav.pdf).
  I was awarded a runners up prize for best talk by the IoP.
