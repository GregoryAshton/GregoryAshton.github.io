# Getting a usable linux environment on Windows

The Windows OS used to be unusable for most scientists due to a host of compatibility issues. But, Windows now offers the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" which has changed that. Here are some links to useful guides

1. [Installing Ubuntu in WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). The default OS is Ubuntu, this has worked well for me. It is worth making sure you install WSL2.

2. In theory, WSL now supports GUI apps natively (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps)). I have yet to get this working, but it looks great.

3. I have found that the [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) works really well. I actually prefer this to the native terminal in Ubuntu itself. There is a SO post [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56765067/how-do-i-get-windows-10-terminal-to-launch-wsl) on getting it to launch WSL, but I think this may be a little out of date. You can add WSL by simply adding a new profile.
