# Getting started in the LIGO Collaboration

There is a guide to getting started in the Collaboration, you can find this [here](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1400033). This contains a wealth of information. Here, I'm just listing a few other things I find useful.

1. If you use the Google chrome browser, you can use a [Profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) associated with your LIGO account. This creates a separate browser window which, by default, logs in to things with your LIGO credentials. This greatly reduced the amount of clicking between different Google logins I have to do when following links.

2. Want to email someone in the collaboration, but not sure of their address? You can head to https://contacts.google.com/ and log in with your LIGO Credentials. This will provide you with all the `albert.einstein@ligo.org` addresses. With this, you can download it as a CSV and upload it to your email client. Now you have all of LIGO on tab completion!
