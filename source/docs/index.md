# Dr Gregory Ashton

## About me

I am a Adjunct Research Associate at Monash University and a Teaching Fellow
at Royal Holloway (University of London), a gravitational-wave
astrophysicist, and member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](http://www.ligo.org).

In 2016, I completed my PhD [Timing variations in neutron stars: models,
inference and their implications for gravitational
waves](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/401822/1/GregoryAshton_Thesis_WithLinks.pdf)
at the University of Southampton under the joint supervision of [Prof. David
Ian Jones ](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/dij.page) and [Dr.
Reinhard Prix ](https://www.aei.mpg.de/person/23802/2168") (Albert Einstein
Institute, Hannover). I then worked as a Postdoc in Hannover with Reinhard and
others in the [Continuous Gravitational Wave
group](https://www.aei.mpg.de/continuouswaves), before moving to Melbourne to
work with [Paul Lasky](http://users.monash.edu.au/~plasky/) in Monash
University (Melbourne Australia). In 2020, I moved back to the UK and am
currently teaching foundation year maths at Royal Holloway.

## News

* 29/Jun/2021 The LVK collaboration published [Observation of gravitational waves from two neutron star-black hole coalescences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15163) in ApJL. This was a really fun project to be involved in. That we can make a definitive statement about the nature of the secondary (light-mass) object with a counterpart is testament to our understanding of controlling systematic uncertainty.

* 17/Jun/2021 We released a new paper: [Bilby-MCMC: An MCMC sampler for gravitational-wave inference](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210608730A/abstract). This was really fun as I got to write a sampler from scratch and remind myself of all the gory details.

* 16/Jun/2021 I helped out with the Royal Holloway [Particle Physics Masterclass](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/studying-here/schools-and-colleges/activities-by-subject/physics/) introducing python programming.

* 11/May/2021 New paper with PhD student Zhi-Qiang You: [Optimized localization for gravitational-waves from merging binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04263) submitted to MNRAS.

* 10/May/2021 The Gravitational Wave Open Data Workshop #4 kicked off today on [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

* 12/Apr/2021 Today I was elected as co-chair of the LIGO collaboration Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) group. I join Chad Hanna and Walter Del Pozzo and look forward to helping coordinate the discovery and analysis of signals from colliding black holes and neutron stars.

* 08/Apr/2021 Today I'm taking part in Royal Holloway's Astrophysics Residential for 2021. I'm covering an [introduction to programming and how to calculate Pi using random numbers](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/AstrophysicsResidentialApril21).

* 12/Mar/2021 My students successfully nominated me for a [You’re Valued Award at Royal Holloway](https://www.su.rhul.ac.uk/voice/awards/#:~:text=You're%20Valued%20is%20a,we%20and%20the%20College%20promote.). I'm proud to add some of their comments here: “Greg is an amazing teacher. His enthusiastic approach to teaching maths to us foundation year students has made us enthusiastic as well. he is very friendly and approachable and when we need help he very patiently helps explain everything to us. He is dedicated to make us understand all  the concepts he teaches and help us learn to our best capacity.” and “Greg always focuses on our individual worries and makes sure we understand before moving on. He's very good at teaching and we're happy to have him as our maths professor :)”.

* 08/Feb/2021 I presented [Flickering of the Vela pulsar](pdfs/Flickering_of_the_vela_pulsar.pdf) to the [CAMK](https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/) journal club.

* 28/Jan/2021 My PhD student Nikhil Sarin passed his pre-submission milestone. It has been a pleasure to watch Nik develop into a great researcher - his next employer will be lucky to have him.

* 27/Jan/2021 New paper on arXiv! Work led by David Keitel ["PyFstat: a Python package for continuous gravitational-wave data analysis"](PyFstat: a Python package for continuous gravitational-wave data analysis) which updates the latest on the PyFstat package for Continuous-Wave analyses.

* 11/Jan/2021 Semester 2 gets underway at RHUL. I'm teaching FY1006 Mathematics II to 140 students in online mode for the foreseable future.

* 07/Jan/2021 I gave a talk titled ["The deepening mystery of the Vela radio-pulsar glitch"](pdfs/Bar-Ilan.pdf) at the Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University on our recent Vela paper.

* 04/Dec/2020 I gave an improptu talk to the University of Southampton's [astrophysics group](http://www.astro.soton.ac.uk/) on our recent Vela paper.

* 16/Nov/2020 New paper ["Flickering of the Vela pulsar during its 2016 glitch"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201107927A/abstract) on the arXiv.

* 10/Nov/2020 I was awarded the [2020 USERN Physical and Chemical Sciences prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USERN_Prize#Laureates_2020).

* 04/Nov/2020 I gave a presentation to Royal Holloway's Physics group ["Turning Wiggles into Science"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11MZHN7b9J_f_HiNVovemcG2IuKSGWXeKzdRh7Kv54v0/edit?usp=sharing)
