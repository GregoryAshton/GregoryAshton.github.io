## About me

I am a Adjunct Research Associate at Monash University and a Teaching Fellow
at Royal Holloway (University of London), a gravitational-wave
astrophysicist, and member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](http://www.ligo.org).

In 2016, I completed my PhD [Timing variations in neutron stars: models,
inference and their implications for gravitational
waves](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/401822/1/GregoryAshton_Thesis_WithLinks.pdf)
at the University of Southampton under the joint supervision of [Prof. David
Ian Jones ](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/dij.page) and [Dr.
Reinhard Prix ](https://www.aei.mpg.de/person/23802/2168") (Albert Einstein
Institute, Hannover). I then worked as a Postdoc in Hannover with Reinhard and
others in the [Continuous Gravitational Wave
group](https://www.aei.mpg.de/continuouswaves), before moving to Melbourne to
work with [Paul Lasky](http://users.monash.edu.au/~plasky/) in Monash
University (Melbourne Australia). In 2020, I moved back to the UK and am
currently teaching foundation year maths at Royal Holloway.
