    "In the examples above, the probability distributions did not contain any additional parameters or nuisance parameters which may be part of the model. Such a name is misleading if one considers them to make pertinent predictions, so here we will refer to them as **model parameters**. In formulating a model, one may have uncertainty about some aspect of the model. For example, if the model was simply Gaussian noise, then one may be uncertain about either or both of the mean and variance. There are many more examples such as having a signal model parameters, or hyper-parameters in a hierarchical model. In all cases however, to compute the evidence, one must **marginalise** over the model parameters. This amounts to using the following identity:\n",
