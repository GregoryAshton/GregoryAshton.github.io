    "Firstly, the odds are equivalent to the Bayes factor, provided we set our prior odds to unity (i.e. no preference between the two models). As such, the thing which is actually calculated is\n",

If the observations are not found at the center between the two models (i.e. $k\\gtrsim1$ such that they favour one model of the other). Then provided the two models are distinctions (i.e. $n \\gtrsim 1$) then the odds-ratio scales with the number of observations. So for $N\\sim 100$ observations one can easily find odds ratios of order $10^{100}$!\n",
