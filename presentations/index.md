# Presentations

* A [talk](Student_seminar02.pdf) on probability theory and Bayesian data
  analysis that I gave for the other PhD students st Southampton.

* Talk at [BritGrav 2014](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/meetings/2014/britgrav.14) where
  I discussed the issue of detecting gravitational waves from neutron stars if 
  the waves are effected by timing noise. The slides can be found [here](BritGrav.pdf).
  I was awarded a runners up prize for best talk by the IoP.
